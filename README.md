## üöÄ Getting Started

To get the backend server up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Node.js** and **npm** installed. **MongoDB** should also be installed and running.

* **Node.js & npm:**
    ```bash
    npm install npm@latest -g
    ```
* **MongoDB:** [Install MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)

### Running the Server

1.  Create a **`.env`** file in the root of your project and add your environment variables:
    ```env
    PORT=3000
    DB_USER=your_mongodb_username
    DB_PASS=your_mongodb_password
    ```
    * `PORT`: The port your backend server will run on (defaulting to 3000 if not specified).
    * `DB_USER` & `DB_PASS`: Your MongoDB Atlas cluster username and password.
    * `NODE_ENV`: Set to `production` in production environments for secure cookie handling (`secure` and `sameSite` settings).
2.  Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The server will typically run on the port specified in your `.env` file (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
